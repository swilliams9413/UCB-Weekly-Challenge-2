# UCB-Weekly-Challenge-2

## Overview of Project:

This was a simple analysis of the annual returns and trade volume of 12 securities. Using VBA, we presented the data in a chart format with the annual performance color coded red and green to make our findings easy to read at a glance.

## Results: 

The results show a net loss for most of the securities in 2018, and the opposite in 2017. This suggests there may have been significant externalities affecting the entire market(s). The large net change in value in both years indicate that many of the securities are highly volitile so Steve may want to look into other companies depending on his parents risk tolerance, and investment horizon.

## Summary:

#### Advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code:

The advantages of refactorying the code are lower memory usage, and shorter time to completion when running the code. With larger data sets the difference in speed and resource use would be more apparant. However, refactoring the code for small data sets like Steve's don't see that much of a return on the time investment. To be clear, the code did run faster when refactored, but the difference was miniscule.
